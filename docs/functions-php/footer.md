# Footer

In tangent, the footer is primarily a Block Template Part. This means that you can customize the footer using the block editor. Block template parts are accessible via the `Appearance` menu in the WordPress Admin. 

However, you can also remove the block template part and code the footer however you'd like, using PHP and even plugins like Advanced Custom Fields.

As of now, there is no way to dynamically insert the current year into the block editor. If your footer includes a copyright date, you'll need to update it manually or code that portion in PHP.
