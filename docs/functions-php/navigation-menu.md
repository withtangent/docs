# Navigation Menu

Tangent's `header.php` uses a "classic" WordPress Menu but is enhanced with much of the same front-end updates in the Gutenberg navigation block. This includes a responsive full screen modal and solid accessibility. To accomplish this, Tangent combines a custom navwalker called `Tangent_Navwalker` with additional JavaScript to enable accessible dropdowns for submenus.
