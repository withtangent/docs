# Build Process

As of now, this repository does _not_ include the final built assets. You'll need to build them once you've cloned the repo. (You may also want to exclude them from your `.gitignore` file, depending on your workflow.)

`npm run build` will build the theme's CSS, JavaScript files, and theme.json.

`npm run watch` will watch for changes to the theme's SCSS, JavaScript files, and theme.json partials and rebuild them automatically.
