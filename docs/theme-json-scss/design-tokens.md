# A Design Token First Approach

Since Tangent is a hybrid theme that takes full advantage of `theme.json`, all styles work in concert with the `theme.json` file. All [design tokens](https://piccalil.li/tutorial/what-are-design-tokens/) (variables, constants, fonts, colors, etc) should be defined in `theme.json`. This makes these design tokens available globally throughout the WordPress front-end and accessible through [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) generated by WordPress.
